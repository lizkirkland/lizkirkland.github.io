What the Critics say

*Much Ado About Nothing* with Theatre Calgary

"In the roles of Hero and Claudio, Elizabeth Kirkland and Tyrell Crews are well cast. Kirkland has a vulnerability about her; Kirkland's Hero is by turns dazzled and destroyed by the overpowering emotions surrounding her."-[Gavin Logan, Talking Broadway](http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/canada/ca14.html)

“Wickedly funny… Engaging, entertaining and guaranteed to give you a giggle… Kirkland and Christie absolutely nail every pairing.”- [Jo Ledingham, Vancouver Courier](http://www.vancourier.com/entertainment/short-plays-prove-wickedly-funny-1.390067)

"Kirkland and Christie have as much fun toying with the gifted building of the laughs as we have in reacting to their sharp sense of timing. Serious and heartfelt ... leaving us laughing.”- Vancouver Sun
