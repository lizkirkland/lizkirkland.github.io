A world devoid of hope breeds predators and prey, nothing else. On his way to a long-abandoned theatre, Alex saves Maryn. They take refuge in the theatre. The work through all that theyâ€™ve learned in this world toward a place of genuine human trust while cleaning the theatre around them, restoring as best they can something outside themselves, something more than the self-serving mentality of this existence. Humans require a cause, something noble, to bring out our true nature of cooperation and innovation and Alex and Maryn must start as we once did: without a light, in a cave.

Directed by Marisa Smith

Featuring Elizabeth Kirkland as Maryn and Victor Ayala as Alex
